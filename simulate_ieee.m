%   This is the simulation for testing the ieee protocol as outlined here: 
%       http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/caiwei/paper/WeiCaiWEHFL2018.pdf
%   Parameters:
%       n = the desired number of simulations to run
%
%   Outputs:
%       None. It will display a graph with 
%       the results of the simulations.
